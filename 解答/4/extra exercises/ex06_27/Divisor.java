// Exercise 6.27 Solution: Divisor.java
// Program finds the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Divisor
{
   // finds the gcd of two numbers
   public static void main( String args[] )
   {
      Scanner input = new Scanner( System.in );
      
      int num1; // first number
      int num2; // second number
      
      System.out.print( "Enter first number (-1 to exit): " );
      num1 = input.nextInt();

         System.out.print( "Enter second number: " );
         num2 = input.nextInt();
      
         System.out.printf( "GCD is: %d\n\n", gcd( num1, num2 ) );
